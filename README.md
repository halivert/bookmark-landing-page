## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- [Vue.js](https://v3.vuejs.org/) - JS framework
- [BEM methodology](http://getbem.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I learn how to use `box-shadow`.

```css
.extension-card {
	--blur-spread: 10px -8px;
	--box-shadow-color: hsl(231, 69%, 60%, 0.1);
	box-shadow: 10px 10px var(--blur-spread) var(--box-shadow-color),
		-10px 10px var(--blur-spread) var(--box-shadow-color);
}
```

This was the simplest form I found to add shadow to extension cards.

### Continued development

The next steps are to improve sectioning with components and improve styles.
Add backend and stuff.

I want to improve my Vue.js comprehension, and BEM styling.
